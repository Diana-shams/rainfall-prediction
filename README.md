# rainfall-prediction
üåßÔ∏è Machine Learning project to predict rainfall in Australia using weather data.  Includes a Jupyter notebook for training and a Streamlit app for interactive predictions.
This repository contains a machine learning project for **rainfall prediction** using 
the [Australian Weather Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsphyg/weather-dataset-rattle-package).  

- Built with **Python, scikit-learn, and Streamlit**
- Trains a **Logistic Regression model** to predict if it will rain tomorrow
- Provides a **Streamlit web app** to test predictions interactively
